### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

\*\*`Software Development, Artificial Intelligence

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a banking analyst turned code wizard with six years of experience shaking things up in the financial world. I've been on the frontlines of digital transformation at big players like JP Morgan Chase and Singapore Exchange, where I've led some pretty impactful projects.

From spearheading new ventures to optimizing market operations, I've been there, done that, and got the results to prove it. Now, I've got my eyes set on diving headfirst into software engineering. Why? Because I'm itching to blend my market savvy with some serious coding skills.

Speaking of skills, I'm your go-to guy for Python, TensorFlow, Java Spring Frameworks, C# .NET Frameworksâ€”you name it, I've probably tinkered with it. Plus, I've got a knack for low-code analytics tools like UiPath, Alteryx, and Tableau.

Bottom line? I'm all about using my software chops to make things run smoother, faster, and more innovatively. Let's connect and cook up some game-changing solutions together! ðŸ”¥
